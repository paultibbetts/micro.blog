This means you can run your own apps and services at home and use Pangolin to let your friends and family connect to them.</p>\n<p>You can do the same thing with <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/\">Cloudflare tunnels</a> except that way Cloudflare can read everything that goes through the tunnel and they don&rsquo;t want you using it for movies, so you&rsquo;re not supposed to use it for Jellyfin or Plex.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m not planning on using it for Jellyfin, but I like that the option&rsquo;s there with Pangolin, and that it&rsquo;s hosted on my own server.</p>\n<h2 id=\"hosting\">Hosting</h2>\n<p>Except it&rsquo;s not my own server, because I don&rsquo;t have one of those huge internet cables like the big companies do, so I have to rent access to one from them.</p>\n<p>It doesn&rsquo;t need to be a big server, only 1GB of RAM and 1 vCPU, which you can get for $1 per month if you go with <a href=\"https://my.racknerd.com/aff.php?aff=13788&amp;pid=912\">RackNerd</a>.</p>\n<p>Which is great if you live in the US, since you&rsquo;re close to any one of the 6 data centres you can choose from for that offer, but I don&rsquo;t, I live all the way across the pond.</p>\n<h2 id=\"uk-hosting\">UK Hosting</h2>\n<p>The closer this server is to where I am the better. In the UK server hosting mainly happens in London, which is close enough to me to be super fast, even if there are other places I could choose.</p>\n<p>Like Manchester, which is closer to me than London. I was surprised to find they had their own data centres I could host from. I could only find one company that offered it publicly though, which was ran by an American company.</p>\n<p>I don&rsquo;t want to talk about recent events, but I don&rsquo;t want to spend my money with a company that pays its taxes to a government that just bombed the country my friend&rsquo;s family lives in. I&rsquo;m not getting involved in any of this. I will choose a different company.</p>\n<p>Preferably one in the UK; as I&rsquo;ve aged I&rsquo;ve realised it&rsquo;s up to us to keep this island afloat.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mythic-beasts\">Mythic Beasts</h2>\n<p>A quick Reddit search led me to <a href=\"https://www.mythic-beasts.com/\">Mythic Beasts</a>, an independent, privately owned company based in the UK, with lots of good reviews.</p>\n<p>They even had a blog, and it didn&rsquo;t take long to find a post titled &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.mythic-beasts.com/blog/2025/02/25/supporting-the-open-rights-group/\">Supporting the Open Rights Group</a>&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>Yep, that&rsquo;s all I need to read, I&rsquo;m hosting my server here with these beasts.</p>\n<h2 id=\"pi\">Pi?</h2>\n<p>Mythic Beasts have their own <a href=\"https://www.mythic-beasts.com/order/rpi/\">rack of Raspberry Pis</a> you can rent from.</p>\n<p>Hosting on someone else&rsquo;s computer isn&rsquo;t a natural fit for the self-hosted way of doing things. But doing it on a Pi? That feels better for some reason.</p>\n<p>Time to do a little test&hellip;<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<h2 id=\"terraform-provider\">Terraform Provider?</h2>\n<p>I could have just clicked on the website to order a Pi. Maybe I should have.</p>\n<p>Mythic Beasts have an API, so you can script your order and the management of the Pi, not that it needs much management. What they don&rsquo;t have, which surprised me a little, is a Terraform Provider.</p>\n<p>A Terraform Provider is the bit that connects Terraform, an industry standard tool for writing down servers as code, to the API of the server provider.</p>\n<p>An ex member of staff <a href=\"https://github.com/jbayfield/terraform-provider-mythic/tree/main\">started one</a> using the older version of the Terraform Provider code, but they had archived it and since left the company.</p>\n<p>Which gave me an idea.</p>\n<h2 id=\"i-will-write-one\">I will write one!</h2>\n<p>I was looking for a chance to practise writing Go, as well as create a project to put on my GitHub, which had gotten a little quiet recently, and now I&rsquo;d found one.</p>\n<p>How hard could it be?</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-arent-the-docs-accurate\">WHY AREN&rsquo;T THE DOCS ACCURATE?!</h2>\n<p>A small gripe, if I may, is that it helps if your API documentation is accurate. The docs I was reading were mostly accurate, and I could get around whatever differences there were, but it had been a while since I&rsquo;d coded against someone else&rsquo;s API and I&rsquo;d forgotten this happens.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ipv6\">IPv6?</h2>\n<p>Since there are no more IPv4 addresses left the Pis are IPv6 only. Mythic Beasts host proxies that let you get into the Pis from IPv4 connections, which works for websites, but Pangolin needs a different type of access.</p>\n<h2 id=\"newt\">Newt?</h2>\n<p>Pangolin is the website part of the project, it&rsquo;s the bit the users see and is hosted on the Pi.

				"content_text": "Most things in tech play out like [that scene from Malcom in the Middle](https://youtu.be/5W4NFcamRhM?si=UfMWOyK6d9hEitz-), where Hal's trying to do one thing and then he needs to do another, and another, until he's forgotten where he started.\n\nPangolin on a Pi started off as a quick little test that turned into a week long adventure.\n\n## Pangolin\n\n[Pangolin](https://docs.fossorial.io/Getting%20Started/overview) is an app that lets you tunnel into a private network, securely, from the outer internet. This means you can run your own apps and services at home and use Pangolin to let your friends and family connect to them.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nYou can do the same thing with [Cloudflare tunnels](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/) except that way Cloudflare can read everything that goes through the tunnel and they don't want you using it for movies, so you're not supposed to use it for Jellyfin or Plex.\n\nI'm not planning on using it for Jellyfin, but I like that the option's there with Pangolin, and that it's hosted on my own server.\n\n## Hosting\n\nExcept it's not my own server, because I don't have one of those huge internet cables like the big companies do, so I have to rent access to one from them.\n\nIt doesn't need to be a big server, only 1GB of RAM and 1 vCPU, which you can get for $1 per month if you go with [RackNerd](https://my.racknerd.com/aff.php?aff=13788&pid=912). \n\nWhich is great if you live in the US, since you're close to any one of the 6 data centres you can choose from for that offer, but I don't, I live all the way across the pond.\n\n## UK Hosting\n\nThe closer this server is to where I am the better. In the UK server hosting mainly happens in London, which is close enough to me to be super fast, even if there are other places I could choose.\n\nLike Manchester, which is closer to me than London. I was surprised to find they had their own data centres I could host from. I could only find one company that offered it publicly though, which was ran by an American company. \n\nI don't want to talk about recent events, but I don't want to spend my money with a company that pays its taxes to a government that just bombed the country my friend's family lives in. I'm not getting involved in any of this. I will choose a different company.\n\nPreferably one in the UK; as I've aged I've realised it's up to us to keep this island afloat. \n\n## Mythic Beasts\n\nA quick Reddit search led me to [Mythic Beasts](https://www.mythic-beasts.com/), an independent, privately owned company based in the UK, with lots of good reviews.\n\nThey even had a blog, and it didn't take long to find a post titled \"[Supporting the Open Rights Group](https://www.mythic-beasts.com/blog/2025/02/25/supporting-the-open-rights-group/)\".\n\nYep, that's all I need to read, I'm hosting my server here with these beasts.\n\n## Pi?\n\nMythic Beasts have their own [rack of Raspberry Pis](https://www.mythic-beasts.com/order/rpi/) you can rent from.\n\nHosting on someone else's computer isn't a natural fit for the self-hosted way of doing things. But doing it on a Pi? That feels better for some reason.\n\nTime to do a little test...<img src=\"https://micro.paultibbetts.uk/uploads/2025/rick-n-morty-quick-adventure.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"250\" alt=\"Rick & Morty quick adventure meme 1/2: Rick & Morty stand in a school hallway next to a glowing green portal, with the caption LETS GO. IN AND OUT. 20 MINUTE ADVENTURE.\">\n\n## Terraform Provider?\n\nI could have just clicked on the website to order a Pi. Maybe I should have.\n\nMythic Beasts have an API, so you can script your order and the management of the Pi, not that it needs much management. What they don't have, which surprised me a little, is a Terraform Provider.\n\nA Terraform Provider is the bit that connects Terraform, an industry standard tool for writing down servers as code, to the API of the server provider.\n\nAn ex member of staff [started one](https://github.com/jbayfield/terraform-provider-mythic/tree/main) using the older version of the Terraform Provider code, but they had archived it and since left the company.\n\nWhich gave me an idea.\n\n## I will write one!\n\nI was looking for a chance to practise writing Go, as well as create a project to put on my GitHub, which had gotten a little quiet recently, and now I'd found one.\n\nHow hard could it be?\n\n## WHY AREN'T THE DOCS ACCURATE?!\n\nA small gripe, if I may, is that it helps if your API documentation is accurate. The docs I was reading were mostly accurate, and I could get around whatever differences there were, but it had been a while since I'd coded against someone else's API and I'd forgotten this happens.\n\n## IPv6?\n\nSince there are no more IPv4 addresses left the Pis are IPv6 only. Mythic Beasts host proxies that let you get into the Pis from IPv4 connections, which works for websites, but Pangolin needs a different type of access.\n\n## Newt?\n\nPangolin is the website part of the project, it's the bit the users see and is hosted on the Pi. It works by letting only the right users into the secure Wireguard tunnel that goes into your home network.\n\nThe thing that you host at home that sets up the other side of the tunnel is called Newt. It uses Wireguard for the tunnel, and that speaks to the Pi on a particular port which **isn't proxied by Mythic Beasts**.\n\n## Another proxy?\n\nMaybe you could get another proxy for this, but then you're hosting a tunnel for your tunnel.\n\nSo no.\n\n## IPv6!\n\nYou don't need a proxy if you can connect to the Pi through IPv6. \n\nExcept I couldn't.\n\nI've known for years that we've ran out of IPv4 addresses and that they're being passed around from company to company for larger and larger amounts of money. \n\nSomehow IPv4 still works and we're still using it, so I always thought I could deal with it when it became a problem. \n\nLike it just had.\n\n## ...\n<img src=\"https://micro.paultibbetts.uk/uploads/2025/rick-n-morty-meme-one-week-later.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"287\" alt=\"Rick & Morty meme 2/2: One week later\">\nI now have IPv6 working at home which means I can connect to the Pi without a proxy 🎉.\n\nI will write up what I did another time, this quick update is over 1,000 words already.\n\nThe next steps are:\n\n- install Newt on my home server\n- connect it to the Pi\n- profit\n",

I was and still am very excited for [Stalker 2]() , which has a heartbreaking behind-the-scenes story to go with it, but I haven't tried it yet.\n\n\nFor the Christmas break this year I found myself continuing on from where I left Arthur and the gang the last time I played this, so RDR2 wins this category for me.\n\n\n## Sit Back and Relax: Dave the Diver\n\n\n[![Dave the Diver](https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1868140/header.jpg?t=1734352338)](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1868140/DAVE_THE_DIVER/)\n\n\nThis award almost went to [Goobies](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2294130/Goobies/), which helps me turn my brain off, but it gets beaten by Dave the Diver for that moment you unlock a new sushi recipe for your restaurant and the music plays and then the fish looks at the camera.\n\n\n\n",

Which is missing the point of doing this with code.\n\nInstead, using `data`  means this block is a data source, called `paultibbetts_dot_uk`, which uses Cloudflare's `cloudflare_zone` module to get a zone (domain) with a name of `paultibbetts.uk`.\n\nI don't know or care what the ID is and I can automate the process of finding it out.\n\n```hcl\nresource \"cloudflare_record\" \"microblog\" {\n  zone_id = data.cloudflare_zone.paultibbetts_dot_uk.id\n  name    = \"micro\"\n  type    = \"CNAME\"\n  value   = \"paultibbetts.micro.blog\"\n  ttl     = 300\n}\n```\n\nWhen I create a `cloudflare_record` resource, called `microblog`, I can use the data source to get the ID of the zone for which domain the `CNAME` record should be added to.\n\n### `vars.tf`\n\n```hcl\nvariable \"cloudflare_api_token\" {\n  type        = string\n  description = \"api token\"\n}\n```\n\nBecause I don't want to write down my API token in my code I set it up as a variable.\n\nI can now pass in the token when I run Terraform:\n\n```sh\nterraform apply \\ \n-var cloudflare_api_token=\"********\" \\ \n```\n\nbut I prefer loading it in as an environment variable.\n\nYou can do this by prefixing the variable with `TF_VAR`:\n\n```sh\n# secrets.sh\nexport TF_VAR_cloudflare_api_token=********\n```\n\nand remembering to source this file before you run Terraform commands\n\n```sh\nsource secrets.sh\nterraform apply\n```\n\n### apply\n\nNow I can run `terraform apply`, confirm the proposed changes, and Terraform will use the Cloudlfare API to add the CNAME to my domain for me. \n\nAfter [making a quick change in Micro.blog](https://help.micro.blog/t/custom-domain-names/53/24) I'm live at my own domain 🥳\n",

I'll finish it before I go back to work.\n\n[The Art of Monitoring](https://micro.blog/books/9780988820241) - is helping to unravel the mysteries of monitoring web applications.\n\n### Fiction\n\n[Arisen Raiders: The Last Raid](https://micro.blog/books/9798837991578?title=Arisen&author=Michael+Stephen+Fuchs&cover_id=161975) 🧟 - I don't like the look of that title!\n\n## Blog\n\nI've recently signed up to [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog) and it has a lot more features than my previous blog, so for now it's my home on the internet. \n\nI'm planning on using it for general updates and [photos of bread](https://paultibbetts.micro.blog/2024/05/02/japanesestyle-sandwich-bread.html) of course, like any good blog, but also for recording design decisions in my development work, updates to my homelab and other nerdy things.\n\nI'd like to make some progress on my own blogging system, and then these things can go there instead, but I don't have that yet, so I'll use Micro.blog to track my progress working towards that.\n",
