Which is missing the point of doing this with code.\n\nInstead, using `data`  means this block is a data source, called `paultibbetts_dot_uk`, which uses Cloudflare's `cloudflare_zone` module to get a zone (domain) with a name of `paultibbetts.uk`.\n\nI don't know or care what the ID is and I can automate the process of finding it out.\n\n```hcl\nresource \"cloudflare_record\" \"microblog\" {\n  zone_id = data.cloudflare_zone.paultibbetts_dot_uk.id\n  name    = \"micro\"\n  type    = \"CNAME\"\n  value   = \"paultibbetts.micro.blog\"\n  ttl     = 300\n}\n```\n\nWhen I create a `cloudflare_record` resource, called `microblog`, I can use the data source to get the ID of the zone for which domain the `CNAME` record should be added to.\n\n### `vars.tf`\n\n```hcl\nvariable \"cloudflare_api_token\" {\n  type        = string\n  description = \"api token\"\n}\n```\n\nBecause I don't want to write down my API token in my code I set it up as a variable.\n\nI can now pass in the token when I run Terraform:\n\n```sh\nterraform apply \\ \n-var cloudflare_api_token=\"********\" \\ \n```\n\nbut I prefer loading it in as an environment variable.\n\nYou can do this by prefixing the variable with `TF_VAR`:\n\n```sh\n# secrets.sh\nexport TF_VAR_cloudflare_api_token=********\n```\n\nand remembering to source this file before you run Terraform commands\n\n```sh\nsource secrets.sh\nterraform apply\n```\n\n### apply\n\nNow I can run `terraform apply`, confirm the proposed changes, and Terraform will use the Cloudlfare API to add the CNAME to my domain for me. \n\nAfter [making a quick change in Micro.blog](https://help.micro.blog/t/custom-domain-names/53/24) I'm live at my own domain ü•≥\n",
