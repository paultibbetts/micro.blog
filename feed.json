This means I can manage different things in Cloudflare using a few settings.\n\n```hcl\nprovider \"cloudflare\" {\n  api_token = var.cloudflare_api_token\n}\n```\n\nNext I tell the Cloudflare provider to use a variable for my API token.\n\n```hcl\ndata \"cloudflare_zone\" \"paultibbetts_dot_uk\" {\n  name = \"paultibbetts.uk\"\n}\n```\n\nOriginally I asked ChatGPT how to do this, and it was technically correct, but it wanted me to go on the Cloudflare site, go to my domain, and copy the `zone_id` to pass in as a variable. Which is missing the point of doing this with code.\n\nInstead, using `data`  means this block is a data source, called `paultibbetts_dot_uk`, which uses Cloudflare's `cloudflare_zone` module to get a zone (domain) with a name of `paultibbetts.uk`.\n\nI don't know or care what the ID is and I can automate the process of finding it out.\n\n```hcl\nresource \"cloudflare_record\" \"microblog\" {\n  zone_id = data.cloudflare_zone.paultibbetts_dot_uk.id\n  name    = \"micro\"\n  type    = \"CNAME\"\n  value   = \"paultibbetts.micro.blog\"\n  ttl     = 300\n}\n```\n\nWhen I create a `cloudflare_record` resource, called `microblog`, I can use the data source to get the ID of the zone for which domain the `CNAME` record should be added to.\n\n### `vars.tf`\n\n```hcl\nvariable \"cloudflare_api_token\" {\n  type        = string\n  description = \"api token\"\n}\n```\n\nBecause I don't want to write down my API token in my code I set it up as a variable.\n\nI can now pass in the token when I run Terraform:\n\n```sh\nterraform apply \\ \n-var cloudflare_api_token=\"********\" \\ \n```\n\nbut I prefer loading it in as an environment variable.\n\nYou can do this by prefixing the variable with `TF_VAR`:\n\n```sh\n# secrets.sh\nexport TF_VAR_cloudflare_api_token=********\n```\n\nand remembering to source this file before you run Terraform commands\n\n```sh\nsource secrets.sh\nterraform apply\n```\n\n### apply\n\nNow I can run `terraform apply`, confirm the proposed changes, and Terraform will use the Cloudlfare API to add the CNAME to my domain for me. \n\nAfter [making a quick change in Micro.blog](https://help.micro.blog/t/custom-domain-names/53/24) I'm live at my own domain 🥳\n",

I need to fix that.\n\n**Hiking** - I'm always thinking about the next destination\n\n### Gaming\n\n[Helldivers 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/553850/HELLDIVERS_2/) - for co-op\n\n[The Finals](https://www.reachthefinals.com/) - for competitive PVP\n\n[Dave the Diver](https://mintrocketgames.com/en/DaveTheDiver) - for relaxing\n\n## Projects\n\n### Dev\n\n**Recommend.li** - over seven years ago my colleagues and I wanted an app to send recommendations to each other, and we still haven't found the right one, so now we're making it ourselves.\n\n**Learning Go** - because it looks better suited for the DevOps work I do nowadays.\n\n### Ops\n\n**Homelab** - now I've got dedicated time to work on it I'm making more progress on my homelab than I have since I started it.\n\n## Reading\n\n### Non-fiction\n\n[Deep Work](https://micro.blog/books/9781455586660?title=Deep+Work&author=Cal+Newport&cover_id=161982) - I read this years ago and taking some time off to get some work done seemed like a perfect time to reread it.\n\n[DevOps Handbook](https://micro.blog/books/9781942788072) - I really like this. I got to the part about \"starting a DevOps movement in your company\" and then started my sabbatical, so for now I'm reading the other books. I'll finish it before I go back to work.\n\n[The Art of Monitoring](https://micro.blog/books/9780988820241) - is helping to unravel the mysteries of monitoring web applications.\n\n### Fiction\n\n[Arisen Raiders: The Last Raid](https://micro.blog/books/9798837991578?title=Arisen&author=Michael+Stephen+Fuchs&cover_id=161975) 🧟 - I don't like the look of that title!\n\n## Blog\n\nI've recently signed up to [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog) and it has a lot more features than my previous blog, so for now it's my home on the internet. \n\nI'm planning on using it for general updates and [photos of bread](https://paultibbetts.micro.blog/2024/05/02/japanesestyle-sandwich-bread.html) of course, like any good blog, but also for recording design decisions in my development work, updates to my homelab and other nerdy things.\n\nI'd like to make some progress on my own blogging system, and then these things can go there instead, but I don't have that yet, so I'll use Micro.blog to track my progress working towards that.\n",
