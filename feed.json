can run entirely independently using a SQLite database, the local file system for storage, and its own user system for authentication. However it can also use PostgreSQL, S3-compatible storage, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->OIDC<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for auth. Since I have all of those things already running that&rsquo;s how I set it up.## InstallThe docs contain an <a href=\"https://homebox.software/en/installation.html#docker-compose\">example Docker compose file</a> so I started with that. I use Ansible to configure my virtual machines and have one dedicated to Docker Compose stacks, so in my code I created a new directory for HomeBox and added the example Docker Compose file.If I was using the default setup I could have stopped there but I&rsquo;m using the extra things I mentioned above and each one of them needs a secret. Instead of writing the secrets as plain-text I used <a href=\"https://docs.ansible.com/projects/ansible/latest/vault_guide/vault.html\">Ansible vault</a> to encrypt a template file in my repo and then write that as <code>.env</code> to the same directory as the compose file. Docker Compose will automatically read it and use its values when referenced in the <code>docker-compose.yaml</code> file.## DatabaseI have a virtual machine dedicated to running Postgres and use the <a href=\"https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-role-postgresql/\">geerlingguy/docker-role-postgresql</a> role to configure it. In my <code>group_vars/postgres/main.yaml</code> file I added lines for a new <code>homebox</code> database and user to <code>postgresql_databases</code>, <code>postgresql_users</code> and <code>postgresql_hba_entries</code>. The new <code>postgresql_user</code> uses a password of <code>&quot;{{ vault_homebox_database_password }}&quot;</code> so I created a new password and entered it into my <code>group_vars/postgres/vault.yaml</code> file which is also encrypted with Ansible vault.To use it I added:<code>yaml- HBOX_DATABASE_DRIVER=postgres- HBOX_DATABASE_HOST=postgres.infra.home.arpa- HBOX_DATABASE_PORT=5432- HBOX_DATABASE_USERNAME=homebox- HBOX_DATABASE_PASSWORD=${HBOX_DATABASE_PASSWORD}- HBOX_DATABASE_DATABASE=homebox</code>to the <code>environment</code> part of the <code>docker-compose.yaml</code>. The role that sets up the Docker Compose stacks doesn&rsquo;t read the values I set for the Postgres role, so I had to copy the password I used for the database into the encrypted file that creates the <code>.env</code> for HomeBox. I now have that same password written twice, once for the database and once for HomeBox to use it.## StorageI&rsquo;m currently running <a href=\"https://www.min.io/\">MinIO</a> on my <a href=\"https://www.truenas.com/truenas-community-edition/\">TrueNAS Scale</a> machine and I can use that for S3-compatible storage. I set it up before they changed their license and now migrating to an alternative is yet another thing on my TODO list.I created a new bucket by using the <a href=\"https://minio.github.io/mc/\">mc</a> CLI client to run:<code>shmc mb lab/homebox</code>To use it I added:<code>yaml- AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=${AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}- AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=${AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}- HBOX_STORAGE_CONN_STRING=s3://homebox?awssdk=v2&amp;endpoint=http://&lt;NAS_IP&gt;:9000&amp;disable_https=true&amp;s3ForcePathStyle=true</code>to the <code>environment</code> part of my <code>docker-compose.yaml</code>.The &ldquo;AWS&rdquo; (Minio) values are also secrets added to the template that writes out the <code>.env</code> file.The <code>HBOX_STORAGE_CONN_STRING</code> value comes from the <a href=\"https://homebox.software/en/configure/storage.html#tested-s3-compatible-storage\">HomeBox docs</a>.Note to self: I should also set up <code>nas.infra.home.arpa</code> like I did for Postgres.## OIDCI have <a href=\"https://kanidm.com/\">Kanidm</a> set up as an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->IdP<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and it can do OIDC for HomeBox to use for authentication.To create the client in Kanidm I ran:<code>shkanidm system oauth2 create homebox HomeBox &quot;https://homebox.cloud.paultibbetts.uk&quot;kanidm group create homebox_userskanidm group add-members homebox_users paulkanidm system oauth2 update-scope-map homebox homebox_users openid profile email</code>and to set the logo for it I ran:<code>shcurl -o homebox.svg https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sysadminsmedia/homebox/refs/heads/main/docs/public/lilbox.svgkanidm system oauth2 set-image homebox homebox.svg svgrm homebox.svg</code>The docker compose environment values to use Kanidm for OIDC are:<code>yaml- HBOX_OPTIONS_HOSTNAME=homebox.cloud.paultibbetts.uk- HBOX_OIDC_ENABLED=true- HBOX_OIDC_ISSUER_URL=https://&lt;kanidm_domain&gt;/oauth2/openid/homebox- HBOX_OIDC_CLIENT_ID=homebox- HBOX_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET=${HBOX_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET}- HBOX_OPTIONS_TRUST_PROXY=true</code>where <code>HBOX_OIDCD_CLIENT_SECRET</code> is another secret added to the <code>.env</code> template.## DNSI use <a href=\"https://pi-hole.net/\">Pi-hole</a> for ad-blocking and custom DNS records in my homelab.I don&rsquo;t yet have an automated way to configure it, so I did it using the web UI, and wrote another reminder to automate this process.I have an A record for the reverse proxy I use so I created a CNAME for HomeBox that points <code>homebox.cloud.paultibbetts.uk</code> to the reverse proxy.I could set up an A record for HomeBox but that would mean writing out the IP of the reverse proxy, whereas using a CNAME means I can enter its domain, which is easier to remember than numbers. It also means I could move the reverse proxy to another server and I would only need to update the A record for it and all the things pointing to it with CNAMEs would still work.## Reverse proxyI use <a href=\"https://caddyserver.com/\">Caddy</a> as a reverse proxy. This is configured by an Ansible role. Well it should be, I left all the tasks in the playbook but I only use it once in this one playbook so it doesn&rsquo;t need to be.The Caddyfile that configures all my virtual hosts is a template that Ansible writes out. I use <a href=\"https://caddyserver.com/docs/automatic-https#dns-challenge\">Cloudflare&rsquo;s DNS challenge</a> when Caddy requests TLS certificates from Lets Encrypt and that needs a token for Cloudflare so I use an Ansible template file so I can encrypt the token using Ansible vault. I use the DNS challenge because my homelab isn&rsquo;t on the internet so it&rsquo;s not accessible to Lets Encrypt when it tries to do the regular HTTP challenge.For HomeBox I added:<code>https://homebox.cloud.paultibbetts.uk {  reverse_proxy apps.infra.home.arpa:3100}</code>where <code>apps.infra.home.arpa</code> is an A record for the VM with Docker Compose running HomeBox. The <code>3100</code> port was defined earlier in the Docker Compose yaml file:<code>yamlports:  - 3100:7745</code>## DeployTo deploy I ran the <code>apps.yaml</code> playbook to write the <code>docker-compose.yaml</code> file and the <code>.env</code> file that contains all the secrets. This also runs <code>docker compose up -d</code> so the stack is up and running by the end of it.To add the virtual host to Caddy I ran my <code>ingress.yaml</code> playbook that configures Caddy.Because this is my writeup I can pretend it all worked perfectly the first time and I definitely didn&rsquo;t have a typo in my domain.## Initial testI registered a user account using my email and set a password, just in case. I then logged out and tried again using OIDC and it logged me into the same account - this is because my email in Kanidm is the same one I used when registering. Some apps make separate accounts when logging in using a password or with OIDC but I like this approach more.HomeBox doesn&rsquo;t have a super user, it uses a multi-tenant setup where everyone gets their own inventory and you have to invite others to access yours. I haven&rsquo;t tried this yet. I might not ever need it - I don&rsquo;t want anyone else seeing how many unused cables I refuse to throw away.Creating my account proved the database worked ✅, and logging in with Kanidm proved OIDC worked ✅, so I created an item in HomeBox and uploaded a photo and that proved the storage with MinIO worked ✅.</h2>",
