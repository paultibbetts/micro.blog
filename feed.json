When they did I considered changing but decided against it.\n\n\n## Registrar\n\n\nI registered my domain with [Heart Internet](https://www.heartinternet.uk/) because that's who we used at work and I didn't have any kind of preference. \n\n\nThey don't expose my personal data when you run a [whois query on the domain](https://www.whois.com/whois/paultibbetts.uk) so I haven't found a reason to move away from them. \n\n\nRenewals are £9.99 per year.\n\n\n## Management\n\n\nFor a while I managed the domain using the interface on Heart Internet but since then I've moved it to [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/).\n\n\nTo do this I changed the nameservers that the domain uses from Heart Internet's to Cloudflare's.\n\n\n## Records\n\n\nThere aren't that many records right now.\n\n\n### @\n\n\nThe apex domain, as in the bare one without any subdomains (`https://paultibbetts.uk`), points to a really small landing page I made for myself. \n\n\nI'll be redoing this soon so I won't talk about it yet.\n\n\n### www\n\n\nI **don't** use the `www` subdomain. \n\n\nI know there are people who think this is wrong but growing up sharing links with others the moment I discovered you could get rid of it I did and haven't looked back.\n\n\nMaybe one day I will revisit this.\n\n\n### micro\n\n\n`micro.paultibbetts.uk` is powered by [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog). \n\n\nI _could_ run my main domain with Micro.blog but I want to have a go at doing that myself.\n\n\nI followed [the Micro.blog guide to set up a custom domain](https://help.micro.blog/t/custom-domain-names/53) and used a `CNAME` on my domain to point `micro` to `https://paultibbetts.micro.blog`.\n\n\n## Emails\n\n\nOnce upon a time I hosted my own email server.\n\n\nThe company I worked at, Sixth Story, had an email address `iwanttowork @ sixthstory` that I thought was clever, so I wanted `hire @ paultibbetts` for myself. Applying for jobs as a web developer I thought it would help me stand out.\n\n\nEven after all the work though I still found myself using my regular Apple email address because I knew it was more stable, and less likely to get marked as spam, so when Apple announced [you can use custom domains with iCloud mail](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102540) I got rid of my email server and used Apple's instead.\n\n\nThis means I have some `MX` and `TXT` records to allow that to work.\n\n\n## In review\n\n\nI have always been jealous of others with better domains than me.\n\n\n### Difficult to spell\n\n\nI have trouble getting people to spell my surname correctly. \n\n\nI don't blame them, there's lots of Bs and Ts, and saying \"technically there's 3 Ts\" isn't helpful when they're typing the double T towards the end.\n\n\n#### Potential fix\n\n\nAral's `ar.al` domain is much better than mine. It's short and easy to spell.\n\n\nMaybe I could find a short domain and set it up to redirect?\n\n\nTime for another disappointing trip to [IWantMyName](https://iwantmyname.com/) to see all the good domains have been taken.\n\n\n### Did you mean the other one?\n\n\nI share a name with someone way more famous than me. \n\n\nIt's spelt a little different but search engines will assume you meant the other Paul.\n\n\n#### Potential fix\n\n\nThere are a few ways I can improve my search engine rankings.\n\n\nI'm going to try writing lots of content to go on my domain, hoping that does it.\n\n\nI will **not** do what the other guy did.\n\n\n### dot UK\n\n\nMy `.uk` address works whilst I live here but it wouldn't if I moved.\n\n\n#### Potential fix\n\n\nI don't have any immediate plans to move abroad so I'm not too concerned with this. \n\n\nIf I ever did I can setup redirects.\n\n\n### Not a cool internet name\n\n\nJeremy Keith's `adactio.com` domain regularly reminds me I'm not creative enough to come up with a cool internet name.\n\n\n#### Potential fix\n\n\nMaybe another decade of thinking about it will help.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

				"content_text": "The last step to setting up my new [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog) was to use it from my own domain.\n\nI debated using it exclusively at `paultibbetts.uk` but I want to work on my own blog for that address.\n\nSo I'm going to use Micro.blog as... my microblog... at `micro.paultibbetts.uk`.\n\nInstead of doing it by hand on Cloudflare's website I wrote it down as code. \n\n## Infrastructure as Code\n\nWriting down your infrastructure as code has a lot of benefits:\n\n- it's in one central place instead of spread out in different UIs on different sites\n- it can be version controlled\n- it can be readable by robots as well as other humans\n\nYou can use tools like [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), [OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/) or [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/) to do this.\n\n## Terraform\n\nI'm using Terraform at the moment. I might look into Pulumi in the future.\n\nTerraform uses [HCL](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/syntax/configuration) for its configuration.\n\n### `main.tf`\n\n```hcl\nterraform {\n  required_providers {\n    cloudflare = {\n      source  = \"cloudflare/cloudflare\"\n      version = \"~> 4.0\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nMy domain is managed by Cloudflare so at the start of my code I tell Terraform to use the `cloudflare/cloudflare` provider. This means I can manage different things in Cloudflare using a few settings.\n\n```hcl\nprovider \"cloudflare\" {\n  api_token = var.cloudflare_api_token\n}\n```\n\nNext I tell the Cloudflare provider to use a variable for my API token.\n\n```hcl\ndata \"cloudflare_zone\" \"paultibbetts_dot_uk\" {\n  name = \"paultibbetts.uk\"\n}\n```\n\nOriginally I asked ChatGPT how to do this, and it was technically correct, but it wanted me to go on the Cloudflare site, go to my domain, and copy the `zone_id` to pass in as a variable. Which is missing the point of doing this with code.\n\nInstead, using `data`  means this block is a data source, called `paultibbetts_dot_uk`, which uses Cloudflare's `cloudflare_zone` module to get a zone (domain) with a name of `paultibbetts.uk`.\n\nI don't know or care what the ID is and I can automate the process of finding it out.\n\n```hcl\nresource \"cloudflare_record\" \"microblog\" {\n  zone_id = data.cloudflare_zone.paultibbetts_dot_uk.id\n  name    = \"micro\"\n  type    = \"CNAME\"\n  value   = \"paultibbetts.micro.blog\"\n  ttl     = 300\n}\n```\n\nWhen I create a `cloudflare_record` resource, called `microblog`, I can use the data source to get the ID of the zone for which domain the `CNAME` record should be added to.\n\n### `vars.tf`\n\n```hcl\nvariable \"cloudflare_api_token\" {\n  type        = string\n  description = \"api token\"\n}\n```\n\nBecause I don't want to write down my API token in my code I set it up as a variable.\n\nI can now pass in the token when I run Terraform:\n\n```sh\nterraform apply \\ \n-var cloudflare_api_token=\"********\" \\ \n```\n\nbut I prefer loading it in as an environment variable.\n\nYou can do this by prefixing the variable with `TF_VAR`:\n\n```sh\n# secrets.sh\nexport TF_VAR_cloudflare_api_token=********\n```\n\nand remembering to source this file before you run Terraform commands\n\n```sh\nsource secrets.sh\nterraform apply\n```\n\n### apply\n\nNow I can run `terraform apply`, confirm the proposed changes, and Terraform will use the Cloudlfare API to add the CNAME to my domain for me. \n\nAfter [making a quick change in Micro.blog](https://help.micro.blog/t/custom-domain-names/53/24) I'm live at my own domain 🥳\n",

				"content_html": "<p>I thought I knew how to type.</p>\n<p>For years I&rsquo;ve been able to type without looking at the keys and I could get used to a new keyboard in hours, if not minutes.</p>\n<p>Then <a href=\"https://paultibbetts.micro.blog/2024/05/02/its-new-keyboard.html\">I bought a new keyboard</a> that looks like this:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>and realised how wrong I was.</p>\n<h2 id=\"hunter-pecker\">Hunter Pecker</h2>\n<p>It turns out I&rsquo;d become extremely proficient at hunting for keys and pecking at them with my index fingers. My hands knew where all the keys were but I primarily used my index fingers to push the buttons.</p>\n<p>Maybe the button was far enough away from the centre and I&rsquo;d use my <del>swearing</del> middle finger. Or it was right on the edge of the keyboard and I&rsquo;d use my ring finger. </p>\n<p>It worked for me for years, adapting from keyboard to keyboard and I could type at around 100 words per minute.</p>\n<h2 id=\"using-100-of-my-brain\">Using 100% of my brain</h2>\n<p>When I got my new keyboard I decided to learn it properly. </p>\n<p>I&rsquo;d watch the videos, follow the guides and use the many different training apps available.</p>\n<p>And I&rsquo;d use my little fingers if I had to.</p>\n<p>I considered switching to a more modern keyboard layout, one that was designed for better efficiency, but I wanted to learn the new keyboard first.</p>\n<p>A new layout can come later, then I&rsquo;ll be using 100% of my brain.</p>\n<h2 id=\"training-regime\">Training regime</h2>\n<p>I got my new keyboard on the 2nd of May and each day I would practise typing on <a href=\"https://www.keybr.com/\">keybr</a>. </p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s important to not overdo it, so I would spend about 30 minutes of typing and leave it for a few hours before having another go. I set the timer on keybr to 2 hours per day, the highest it would go, and stopped when I hit it.</p>\n<p>Or I&rsquo;d stop way before then.</p>\n<p>Typing was painful!</p>\n<p>It wasn&rsquo;t a sharp pain, and it wasn&rsquo;t severe, but years of only using 2 or 3 fingers to type had to be unlearnt and my little fingers had more buttons to press than ever before.</p>\n<p>Some days it felt like I wasn&rsquo;t getting any better and I would never learn how to do it, but each morning I would find my fingers a little stronger and that my muscle memory had adapted a little bit more.</p>\n<p>Apart from that one time I went to type on my Macbook and I glitched.</p>\n<p>Hands hovering above the keyboard my brain couldn&rsquo;t find the relevant instructions to function and my whole body froze until it did.</p>\n<h2 id=\"keybr\">keybr</h2>\n<p>I settled on <a href=\"https://www.keybr.com/\">keybr</a> over the others because the guided lessons limited the keys I had to press and only unlocked the next key when it thought I was ready to progress.</p>\n<p>Which was a bit weird, because my fingers knew where the next unlocked key would be before my brain told them where it was.</p>\n<p>I felt like an octopus the way my hands moved without my brain ever telling them where to go.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>In total I&rsquo;ve spent 12 hours doing 730 lessons on keybr.

				"content_text": "I thought I knew how to type. \n\nFor years I've been able to type without looking at the keys and I could get used to a new keyboard in hours, if not minutes.\n\nThen [I bought a new keyboard](https://paultibbetts.micro.blog/2024/05/02/its-new-keyboard.html) that looks like this:\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2024/f8707a474e.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" alt=\"Glove80 ergo mechanical keyboard in the travel case\">\n  \nand realised how wrong I was.\n\n\n\n## Hunter Pecker\n  \nIt turns out I'd become extremely proficient at hunting for keys and pecking at them with my index fingers. My hands knew where all the keys were but I primarily used my index fingers to push the buttons.\n\nMaybe the button was far enough away from the centre and I'd use my ~~swearing~~ middle finger. Or it was right on the edge of the keyboard and I'd use my ring finger. \n\nIt worked for me for years, adapting from keyboard to keyboard and I could type at around 100 words per minute.\n\n\n\n## Using 100% of my brain\n\nWhen I got my new keyboard I decided to learn it properly. \n  \nI'd watch the videos, follow the guides and use the many different training apps available.\n\nAnd I'd use my little fingers if I had to.\n\nI considered switching to a more modern keyboard layout, one that was designed for better efficiency, but I wanted to learn the new keyboard first. \n\nA new layout can come later, then I'll be using 100% of my brain.\n\n\n\n## Training regime\n\nI got my new keyboard on the 2nd of May and each day I would practise typing on [keybr](https://www.keybr.com/). \n\nIt's important to not overdo it, so I would spend about 30 minutes of typing and leave it for a few hours before having another go. I set the timer on keybr to 2 hours per day, the highest it would go, and stopped when I hit it.\n\nOr I'd stop way before then.\n\nTyping was painful!\n\nIt wasn't a sharp pain, and it wasn't severe, but years of only using 2 or 3 fingers to type had to be unlearnt and my little fingers had more buttons to press than ever before.\n\nSome days it felt like I wasn't getting any better and I would never learn how to do it, but each morning I would find my fingers a little stronger and that my muscle memory had adapted a little bit more.\n\nApart from that one time I went to type on my Macbook and I glitched.\n\nHands hovering above the keyboard my brain couldn't find the relevant instructions to function and my whole body froze until it did.\n\n\n\n## keybr\n\nI settled on [keybr](https://www.keybr.com/) over the others because the guided lessons limited the keys I had to press and only unlocked the next key when it thought I was ready to progress.\n\nWhich was a bit weird, because my fingers knew where the next unlocked key would be before my brain told them where it was.\n\nI felt like an octopus the way my hands moved without my brain ever telling them where to go.\n  \n<img src=\"uploads/2024/typing-speed-week-1.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"214\" alt=\"graph showing typing speed, accuracy and unlocked keys on keybr.com\">\n\nIn total I've spent 12 hours doing 730 lessons on keybr. The graph above shows my typing speed in green, accuracy in orange and the purple line shows the amount of keys unlocked. \n\nYou can see the day I thought I knew what I was doing and then found out quickly that I didn't.\n\nSometimes unlocking a new key would throw everything off balance and I'd have to adjust what I was doing. Or sometimes the new key would put something familiar on the map for my hands to anchor around.\n\nAfter 12 hours of practising I've unlocked all the alpha keys on keybr and my brain's adapted to the new layout. \n\nI was even able to type this blog post with my new keyboard!\n\n\n\n## Room for improvement\n\nI'm not very fast at typing right now though.\n\nThis is where the other apps come in.\n\n- [monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com/) is for whole-word training\n- [type-fu](https://type-fu.com/) is another app for whole-word training\n- [ngram](https://ranelpadon.github.io/ngram-type) is for typing ngrams (sequences of characters) to reinforce muscle memory\n\nI'll probably cut down my 2 hours of dedicated training to something more manageable but I'm going to need to keep at it. \n\nIt'd be a bit embarrassing sharing my screen at work right now with me typing so slow and making so many mistakes.\n\nEven worse is that I'm a programmer and I haven't yet learnt where all my symbols are?!\n\n\n\n## Stats\n  \nDay 0: 100 WPM on my regular keyboard\n\nDay 1: 15 WPM on my new keyboard\n\nDays 1-7: practising on keybr for 2 hours per day\n\nDay 8: 60 WPM on my new keyboard\n",
