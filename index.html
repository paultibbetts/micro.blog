<p>7 miles in I made it to the Beech Tree,</p>

<p>where I made a sugar-stop,</p>

			 <p>Another missed opportunity to photograph my food.
Another weeknotes.</p>
<p>I fixed my bike this week. All it needed was the tyres pumping up, but I didn&rsquo;t have the right pump because my new bike uses Presta valves and I&rsquo;d never even heard of them before.</p>
<p>More money later and my bike&rsquo;s road worthy again. Went out for a short ride to celebrate and now I&rsquo;m all achey. Planning on getting out more next week.</p>
<p>Met up with the Recommend.li team at <a href="https://www.colmoretap.co.uk/">The Colmore</a> in Birmingham, which is a great after work spot in the city centre with a ridiculous amount of beers on tap. I had an anchovy pizza and once again forgot about needing content for my blog whilst eating it.</p>
<p>Planned and booked <a href="https://www.westhighlandway.org/">The West Highland Way</a> for June after watching <a href="https://youtu.be/z015CycR2pA?si=j_7OWsxhMWsndL2b">Paul Messner&rsquo;s series</a>. Bought some new gear in preparation. Going to microblog the trip. Can&rsquo;t let good content keep going to waste.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>The last step to setting up my new <a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a> was to use it from my own domain.</p>
<p>I debated using it exclusively at <code>paultibbetts.uk</code> but I want to work on my own blog for that address.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to use Micro.blog as&hellip; my microblog&hellip; at <code>micro.paultibbetts.uk</code>.</p>
<p>Instead of doing it by hand on Cloudflare&rsquo;s website I wrote it down as code.</p>
<h2 id="infrastructure-as-code">Infrastructure as Code</h2>
<p>Writing down your infrastructure as code has a lot of benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>it&rsquo;s in one central place instead of spread out in different UIs on different sites</li>
<li>it can be version controlled</li>
<li>it can be readable by robots as well as other humans</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use tools like <a href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraform</a>, <a href="https://opentofu.org/">OpenTofu</a> or <a href="https://www.pulumi.com/">Pulumi</a> to do this.</p>
<h2 id="terraform">Terraform</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m using Terraform at the moment. I might look into Pulumi in the future.</p>
<p>Terraform uses <a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/syntax/configuration">HCL</a> for its configuration.</p>
<h3 id="maintf"><code>main.tf</code></h3>

    }
  }
}
</code></pre></div><p>My domain is managed by Cloudflare so at the start of my code I tell Terraform to use the <code>cloudflare/cloudflare</code> provider. This means I can manage different things in Cloudflare using a few settings.</p>

<p>Instead, using <code>data</code>  means this block is a data source, called <code>paultibbetts_dot_uk</code>, which uses Cloudflare&rsquo;s <code>cloudflare_zone</code> module to get a zone (domain) with a name of <code>paultibbetts.uk</code>.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know or care what the ID is and I can automate the process of finding it out.</p>

<p>Now I can run <code>terraform apply</code>, confirm the proposed changes, and Terraform will use the Cloudlfare API to add the CNAME to my domain for me.</p>

			 <p>Weeknotes are for when you&rsquo;re eating sushi and forget to take a photo and then later you decide you should tell people about it because it was excellent.</p>
<p>Loved the food at <a href="http://sushimarvel.co.uk/">Sushi Marvel</a> in Manchester. I was too busy eating to take many photos but I paused before tackling the chicken karaage rice bowl so there&rsquo;s at least one of that. I&rsquo;ve recently started a regular pilgrimage to Manchester&rsquo;s food scene and so far Sushi Marvel&rsquo;s been my favourite for food.</p>
<p>Lots of walking this week. Inspired by <a href="https://youtu.be/z015CycR2pA?si=-moWIT457QNHY4pb">Paul Messner&rsquo;s recent trip to Scotland</a> I&rsquo;m now thinking of walking The West Highland Way.</p>
<p>Made a proper start on the app I&rsquo;m working on with my friends. I need to learn what&rsquo;s new in React to work on the frontend.</p>
<p>Decided to redo my Neovim config and make it work the way I want it to. This deserves its own post next week.</p>
<p>Subscribed to Micro.blog ü•≥ I&rsquo;ve decided to use <a href="https://micro.paultibbetts.uk">micro.paultibbetts.uk</a> for the domain and I wrote that DNS setting down as Terraform code instead of doing it by hand. Don&rsquo;t ask how much longer that took me.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m planning on using it for general updates and <a href="https://paultibbetts.micro.blog/2024/05/02/japanesestyle-sandwich-bread.html">photos of bread</a> of course, like any good blog, but also for recording design decisions in my development work, updates to my homelab and other nerdy things.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to make some progress on my own blogging system, and then these things can go there instead, but I don&rsquo;t have that yet, so I&rsquo;ll use Micro.blog to track my progress working towards that.</p>

			 <p>I thought I knew how to type.</p>
<p>For years I&rsquo;ve been able to type without looking at the keys and I could get used to a new keyboard in hours, if not minutes.</p>
<p>Then <a href="https://paultibbetts.micro.blog/2024/05/02/its-new-keyboard.html">I bought a new keyboard</a> that looks like this:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>and realised how wrong I was.</p>
<h2 id="hunter-pecker">Hunter Pecker</h2>
<p>It turns out I&rsquo;d become extremely proficient at hunting for keys and pecking at them with my index fingers. My hands knew where all the keys were but I primarily used my index fingers to push the buttons.</p>
<p>Maybe the button was far enough away from the centre and I&rsquo;d use my <del>swearing</del> middle finger. Or it was right on the edge of the keyboard and I&rsquo;d use my ring finger.¬†</p>
<p>It worked for me for years, adapting from keyboard to keyboard and I could type at around 100 words per minute.</p>
<h2 id="using-100-of-my-brain">Using 100% of my brain</h2>
<p>When I got my new keyboard I decided to learn it properly.¬†</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d watch the videos, follow the guides and use the many different training apps available.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d use my little fingers if I had to.</p>
<p>I considered switching to a more modern keyboard layout, one that was designed for better efficiency, but I wanted to learn the new keyboard first.</p>
<p>A new layout can come later, then I&rsquo;ll be using 100% of my brain.</p>
<h2 id="training-regime">Training regime</h2>
<p>I got my new keyboard on the 2nd of May and each day I would practise typing on <a href="https://www.keybr.com/">keybr</a>.¬†</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to not overdo it, so I would spend about 30 minutes of typing and leave it for a few hours before having another go. I set the timer on keybr to 2 hours per day, the highest it would go, and stopped when I hit it.</p>
<p>Or I&rsquo;d stop way before then.</p>
<p>Typing was painful!</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t a sharp pain, and it wasn&rsquo;t severe, but years of only using 2 or 3 fingers to type had to be unlearnt and my little fingers had more buttons to press than ever before.</p>
<p>Some days it felt like I wasn&rsquo;t getting any better and I would never learn how to do it, but each morning I would find my fingers a little stronger and that my muscle memory had adapted a little bit more.</p>
<p>Apart from that one time I went to type on my Macbook and I glitched.</p>
<p>Hands hovering above the keyboard my brain couldn&rsquo;t find the relevant instructions to function and my whole body froze until it did.</p>
<h2 id="keybr">keybr</h2>
<p>I settled on <a href="https://www.keybr.com/">keybr</a> over the others because the guided lessons limited the keys I had to press and only unlocked the next key when it thought I was ready to progress.</p>
<p>Which was a bit weird, because my fingers knew where the next unlocked key would be before my brain told them where it was.</p>
<p>I felt like an octopus the way my hands moved without my brain ever telling them where to go.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In total I&rsquo;ve spent 12 hours doing 730 lessons on keybr. The graph above shows my typing speed in green, accuracy in orange and the purple line shows the amount of keys unlocked.¬†</p>
<p>You can see the day I thought I knew what I was doing and then found out quickly that I didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Sometimes unlocking a new key would throw everything off balance and I&rsquo;d have to adjust what I was doing. Or sometimes the new key would put something familiar on the map for my hands to anchor around.</p>
<p>After 12 hours of practising I&rsquo;ve unlocked all the alpha keys on keybr and my brain&rsquo;s adapted to the new layout.¬†</p>
<p>I was even able to type this blog post with my new keyboard!</p>
<h2 id="room-for-improvement">Room for improvement</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m not very fast at typing right now though.</p>
<p>This is where the other apps come in.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://monkeytype.com/">monkeytype</a> is for whole-word training</li>
<li><a href="https://type-fu.com/">type-fu</a> is another app for whole-word training</li>
<li><a href="https://ranelpadon.github.io/ngram-type">ngram</a> is for typing ngrams (sequences of characters) to reinforce muscle memory</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ll probably cut down my 2 hours of dedicated training to something more manageable but I&rsquo;m going to need to keep at it.¬†</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be a bit embarrassing sharing my screen at work right now with me typing so slow and making so many mistakes.</p>
<p>Even worse is that I&rsquo;m a programmer and I haven&rsquo;t yet learnt where all my symbols are?!</p>
<h2 id="stats">Stats</h2>
<p>Day 0: 100 WPM on my regular keyboard</p>
<p>Day 1: 15 WPM on my new keyboard</p>
<p>Days 1-7: practising on keybr for 2 hours per day</p>
<p>Day 8: 60 WPM on my new keyboard</p>
